# CBT Planner

This application is a hybrid of different tools and techniques for personal organization and time management, heavily inspired by principles and methodologies used in cognitive behavioral therapy. It is an attempt to supplement, perhaps replace entirely, conventional hard copy daily planners with an app one can use at home and on the go. To this end, it extends it the traditional planner system through the power of computing with modern analytics and data visualization.

The end goal is more ambitious than mimicking a classic daily planner or simplistic to-do lists. It's a tool specifically designed for personalized growth, long term planning, progress tracking, daily productivity and navigating effective paths to success.
