# Personal Organizer

This application is a hybrid of different tools and techniques for personal organization. The basic premise is largely based on organizational principles derived from cognitive behavioral therapy. In addition, it leverages the Pomodoro technique, task breakdowns based on daily planners and modern data visualization tools for analytics.

The end goal isn't to simply mimic a daily planner for the sake of creating to-do lists, manage time and break down short term goals. It is a bit more ambitious than that; a personalized tool for setting long term goals, tracking progress and productivity in order to achieve these. By providing organization tools for daily use, an engine for aggregating data points and making sense of it all, a high level overview of the bigger picture is intended to guide the process, getting there more efficiently and effectively.
